Bind Map Overview
Unique Features
Teleporters

Bind's most distinctive feature is its two one-way teleporters:
A Short to B Short: Teleporter entrance is located at A Short; the exit is at B Short.
B Long to A Lobby: Teleporter entrance is located at B Long; the exit is at A Lobby.
To use a teleporter, players walk into the wall section designated as the entrance, which transports them to a small exit room. The exit door in this room is closed by default and opens automatically when approached by players inside. Players outside the exit room cannot open the doors, but they can shoot through them.
Object Interaction

Objects such as abilities, the spike, and dropped weapons can also be sent through teleporters. They maintain their velocity and can open the exit door if they travel far enough to trigger the door sensor.
Audio Cues

All players on the map receive an audio cue whenever a teleporter is used by an agent or an object.

Summary
The Operator is the most expensive weapon in VALORANT, known for its devastating power and high precision. It features a scope with dual zoom levels, making it ideal for long-range engagements.

It can instantly kill any enemy with a single body shot, making it a powerful choice for players who can handle its high cost and slow rate of fire. Compared to other snipers like the Marshal and Outlaw, the Operator offers superior damage and wall penetration, but its slower fire rate and high price can be a significant drawback.

Brimstone Overview
Name: Liam "Brimstone" Byrne
Role: Controller
Origin: United States
Release Patch: Beta
Voice Actor: Steve Blum

Background:
Liam Byrne, known by his call sign "Brimstone," is the commander of the VALORANT Protocol, a secretive organization dedicated to protecting Earth from disasters and threats involving radianite. A former firefighter and soldier from Baltimore, Brimstone has a deep sense of loyalty to his comrades and the organizations he's served. This loyalty is rooted in a tragic past where he lost a close friend, Tariq Porter, which deeply affected him and led to his involvement with Kingdom Corporation's K-SEC branch.

After the events of First Light, Brimstone left K-SEC and, alongside Sabine Callas, Klara Böhringer, and Omen, founded the VALORANT Protocol. Under his leadership, the organization grew and recruited agents from around the world to prevent agents from the alternate-dimension Omega Earth from stealing radianite from Alpha Earth.

Despite no longer being part of Kingdom, Brimstone's loyalty to their vision remained, leading to internal conflicts when the Protocol had to shut down a dangerous project by Kingdom. Brimstone now faces the challenge of protecting Alpha from Omega's agents while reconciling his feelings about Kingdom's role in global safety.

Personality:
Brimstone is the oldest and most experienced member of the VALORANT Protocol, often encouraging and mentoring his teammates. He refers to the younger agents as "kids" and is known for his stubbornness, resisting any notion of retirement. His leadership is grounded in experience, and he continues to be an active participant in field operations despite his senior role.

Appearance:
Brimstone is a tall, imposing figure, often seen in a blue shirt with a chest plate. He wears an orange beret adorned with a gold insignia depicting two inverted chevrons, likely indicating his military rank. Brimstone has a gray mustache and a thick beard, with gloves on both hands and a bracer on his left wrist.

Sabine Callas, also known as Viper, is an American chemist who played a crucial role in the rediscovery of radianite. Working at Kingdom Corporation, she became one of the first scientists to study radianite.

His journey from being a skilled assassin known as "Ghost" to his current state as a shadowy figure within the VALORANT Protocol is a tale of transformation, loss, and a relentless search for identity.

Backstory
Omen, once known as "Ghost," was a highly skilled assassin working for the Scions of Hourglass, an organization dedicated to preventing the rediscovery of the substance radianite. During his time with the Scions, he was sent on a mission to assassinate Dr. Sabine Callas (now known as Viper) to stop her from uncovering radianite. However, the mission went awry when Dr. Callas defended herself, leading to an accident that drastically altered Omen's form and erased his memories. He was left in a state of confusion and torment, with only vague recollections of his past life.

Years later, as a member of the VALORANT Protocol, Omen's quest for answers took a significant turn when he encountered the hourglass symbol of the Scions. This symbol triggered memories of his past, and with the help of the young assassin Li Zhao Yu (Iso), he began to piece together the fragments of his identity. This culminated in a mission to Jakarta, where Omen confronted his former boss and learned the truth about his past. However, instead of bringing peace, these revelations only deepened his internal conflict.

Personality
Omen's personality is heavily influenced by his traumatic transformation and the loss of his former self. He is a cynical and tormented figure, using his powers to instill fear and paranoia in his enemies. Despite his dark nature, Omen shows a softer side to those he trusts, such as Viper, whom he refers to by her real name, Sabine. He is also known to knit as a way to focus, a small but telling detail that adds depth to his character.

Appearance
Omen's appearance reflects his ethereal and haunting nature. He wears gray armor, black pants, and a purple hooded cape. His arms are wrapped in bandages, and his face is obscured by his hood, with only three bright blue slits visible where his eyes should be. This spectral form is further emphasized when he uses his ultimate ability, which transforms him into a dark shade.

Abilities
Omen's abilities revolve around shadows, teleportation, and manipulating the battlefield to his advantage. His abilities include:

Shrouded Step: A teleportation ability that allows Omen to move quickly across short distances.
Paranoia: A blinding orb that nearsights and deafens all players it touches, passing through walls to reach its target.
Dark Cover: A smoke orb that blocks vision, allowing Omen to control sightlines and obscure his movements.
From the Shadows (Ultimate): A tactical map ability that lets Omen teleport to any location on the map. While teleporting, he appears as a shade that can be destroyed to cancel the teleport.
Recent Developments
After uncovering the truth about his past, Omen's struggle with his identity has only intensified. He has temporarily stepped away from the VALORANT Protocol to recover and find his own path forward. Despite his inner turmoil, Omen remains a loyal member of the Protocol, considering its agents as his new family. He is determined to return to them once he has come to terms with his past and present.

Omen's journey is far from over, and his story continues to evolve as he grapples with the reality of who he was and who he has become.

Reyna Overview

Name: Reyna (Zyanya Mondragón)

Role: Duelist

Origin: Mexico

Release Patch: 1.0

Voice Actor: Karina Altamirano

Biography
Zyanya Mondragón, known by her codename "Reyna", is a formidable Radiant from Mexico. Gifted with the unique ability to absorb life energy from the souls of her slain adversaries, she channels this power to enhance her combat prowess. A catastrophic event involving machinery, presumably tied to the Kingdom Corporation, deeply scarred her, fostering a profound aversion to technology and a cynicism towards humanity. Believing that Radiants represent the true future of Alpha Earth, Reyna established a sanctuary to shield those seeking refuge from Kingdom's influence, positioning herself as their protector and avenger.

Central to Reyna's existence is her younger sister, Lucia, whose life hangs by a thread. To sustain Lucia, Reyna transfers the life energy she collects from her enemies. Despite the assistance of VALORANT Protocol scientists, this process remains inefficient, making every battle and every kill vital in extending Lucia's life. Reyna's relentless aggression and bitterness have sparked concern among her fellow agents, who fear the lengths she might go to if Lucia's fate worsens.

Personality
“Are those our enemies? This won't take long.” — Reyna (Match Start)

Reyna embodies ruthlessness and determination, seizing what she desires without hesitation. Her demeanor is savage, bordering on animalistic, as she revels in eliminating her foes and feeding off their despair. A deep-seated disdain for technology propels her to assert dominance, especially over fellow Radiants, championing their supremacy. Despite her hardened exterior and world-weariness, Reyna acknowledges Alpha Earth as her home, vowing to defend it—even if it demands more bloodshed.

Appearance
Reyna is instantly recognizable by her long hair, with its ends dyed a vivid purple, and her piercing purple eyes that exude an intimidating aura. She dons a sleek, purple skin-tight suit with an asymmetrical design: one sleeve covers her left arm, while her right arm remains exposed, showcasing intricate tattoos that illuminate when she taps into her Radiant abilities. Complementing her attire are purple boots with protective plating, leaving her right thigh bare. A distinct, luminous purple glow emanates from her chest, marking her heart's location. Upon activating her ultimate ability, "Empress," Reyna's entire visage transforms into a deep shade of dark purple, with her eyes, hands, and heart radiating an intense amethyst glow.

Cypher, real name Amir El Amari, is an enigmatic information broker from Rabat, Morocco. Growing up in a city that was exploited by Kingdom Corporation, El Amari developed a deep-seated mistrust towards them. His life in poverty and his surroundings have made him highly secretive, a trait he carries into his role as the fifth agent in the VALORANT Protocol.

He’s known for his resourcefulness and ability to retrieve information, even managing to acquire the passwords of every member of the VALORANT Protocol.

His interactions with other agents show a blend of professionalism and subtle humor, often referring to them with nicknames like "little engineer" for Killjoy and "little star" for Phoenix.

Appearance
Cypher's appearance is reminiscent of a classic detective or gumshoe, with a large white coat that hides his gadgets and tools. He is always seen wearing his black mask, which conceals his face and identity. The mask, with its hexagonal eye holes that emit a bright blue glow, is a high-tech device that serves as his main means of vision.

He has a complex relationship with other agents, particularly Omen and Sova, due to his secretive nature and conflicting values regarding transparency.

Background
Hazal Eyletmez, known as Fade, is a Radiant from Türkiye with a personal vendetta. Her search for a missing individual led her to suspect the VALORANT Protocol of kidnapping him.

Development History
Valorant’s agent roster has grown since its initial release, with Riot Games consistently introducing new characters to keep the game fresh and engaging. Originally, Riot aimed to launch Valorant with 12 agents, but only 8 were available in early press builds. The Closed Beta launch on April 7, 2020, brought the roster to 10 with the addition of Raze.

The development of new agents is a meticulous process, taking around 12–15 months per agent. The design process focuses on filling gaps in the game's playstyles, exploring new thematic opportunities, and ensuring the overall health of the game. Riot's goal is to release a new agent approximately once per act, keeping the game dynamic and allowing players to adapt to new challenges.
